# Practical work of IMAS for the academic course 2014-15


## Practice goal

The main goal is to put in practice the basic concepts of agent technology using
a real framework (JADE).


## Practice description

You have to design and develop a decision making system for disaster situations based on a multi-agent system in
groups of four or five students.

This exercise aims to simulate how rescue entities react to fires in a city. There are two kinds of entities:
(i) firemen, that have to put fires out, and (ii) ambulances that bring injured people from fires to a hospital.

To make the problem finite, we locate fire disasters in a city, seen as a grid of variable size, where a limited
number of elements and allowed interactions appear. The main elements to consider are the following:

* Firemen. Firemen are represented as fire trucks. They have the shared responsibility of putting fires out.
* Hospitals. The city has hospitals to take care of injured inhabitants. Injured people are taken into the hospital
  from the buildings on fire using ambulances.
* Ambulances. These vehicles have a maximum capacity of injured people.
* Private vehicles. They are people that are travelling randomly through the city and that may prevent ambulances
  and firemen from taking the shortest path to the location of the city (fire or hospital) they have to go.
* Streets. Grid cells through which fire trucks, ambulances and private vehicles will be moving. A street cell
  cannot contain more than a vehicle at the same time. Vehicles have to plan the path preventing collisions. When
  two vehicles want to move to the same cell, both remain quiet.
* Buildings. There are grid cells that represent buildings with a certain amount of people in them.
* Fires. Fires can only occur on buildings. If a building is completely destroyed by fire, all its remaining
  citizens are dead. Fires do not spread to neighbour buildings.
* Gas stations. Some grid cells represent gas stations. Vehicles have to go to gas stations before they run out of
  petrol. Considering gas stations in this practical exercise is optional.

Therefore, the goal of the whole system is to try to rescue all the people that inhabit buildings on fire and take
them to a hospital, and try to put out all the fires so that none of the buildings is destroyed. This task should be
done spending the minimum amount of resources (e.g. fuel).


## Technical requirements

Your practical work has to address this problem in two phases:

1. Initialization. This is the first phase in which your whole solution is correctly initialized, loading the
   initial configuration settings from a file, creating all the agents and showing them in their initial positions
   in the graphical interface.
1. Simulation. Once all agents are ready, the evolution of the fires in the city is simulated by steps. At the end
   of each step, all mobile agents know their next position in the city grid.


## Architecture

To address disasters in the city, you have to design and develop the following agents addressing the
responsibilities being detailed:

* SystemAgent. This agent is responsible for:
 * Loading the configuration settings at the initialization phase.
 * Spreading the necessary configuration settings and current status of the city to the CoordinatorAgent.
 * Providing a GUI where to show the city and all its static and mobile elements.
 * Adding new fires into the city in a random and dynamic way.
 * Moving private vehicles randomly throughout the city. See below for more details on this.
* CoordinatorAgent. This agent can communicate with the HospitalCoordinator and the FiremenCoordinator, providing
  them the information given by the SystemAgent.
* FiremenCoordinator. This agent is responsible for coordinating FiremenAgents, so that they get to know where fires
  are.
* HospitalCoordinator. This agent helps to manage the coordination between HospitalAgents, taking into account their
  dynamic load.
* HospitalAgent. Coordinates a set of AmbulanceAgents for bringing injured people to the hospital. Any injured
  citizen in a hospital gets out of the hospital after 3 steps. Each hospital has a configurable amount of beds in
  the initial configuration.
* AmbulanceAgent. These agents are responsible for bringing up to 3 citizens at a time to the hospital. These
  citizens, though, can get in the ambulance at different places from the city. Injured people get in an ambulance
  that is placed in any cell surrounding the fire, at a speed of a person per step.
* FiremenAgent. These agents must coordinate their actions (with the support of the FiremenCoordinator) to reach the
  goal of having no building destroyed by fire, or at least, the minimum number of buildings destroyed and dead
  citizens. To get a fire out, a FiremenAgent has to be placed at any cell surrounding the fire (including diagonal
  cells) until the fire is over. A fire grows at 5% at the end of each simulation step if no firemen are around. If
  there are FiremenAgents around the fire, each of them reduces the fire at a ratio of 5% at the end of each step.

Private vehicles must not be agents. Movements for private vehicles are designed as follows:
1. If a private vehicle is in any street, the private vehicle has to go straight on in the same direction.
2. If a private vehicle arrives at a street cell where the vehicle can turn right and/or left (like in a street
   cross), the private vehicle will have:
 * An 80% of probability of going straight on, and
 * A 20% of turning right or left. Both directions will have the same probability of being chosen whenever they both
   are available.
3. If the private vehicle arrives at a street cell from which cannot go straight on, it will have the same
   probability of turning right or left if both directions are available.

In the following diagram you can see the basic architecture of the described multiagent system:

## Ambulance coordination

You have to choose one of the following coordination schemes among ambulances and hospitals.

1. Ambulances are related to a hospital, so that all loaded injured people in those ambulances are brought to the
   same hospital. For instance, if ambulance1 is related to hospital3, all citiezens loaded in ambulance1 will be
   brought to hospital3.
1. Ambulances are related to the city, not to a hospital, so that injured people can be brought to any hospital. If
   necessary, any ambulance can leave injured people in more than a hospital.

The number of hospitalized people per hospital is the basic issue to consider when deciding which hospital gets
brought additional injured people. At the same time, the path of the ambulance should remain as short as possible
when bringing injured people.


## Ambulances and firemen at work
To clarify the way both ambulance and fireman work, these are the guidelines:

1. Firemen will not put a fire out just passing by the surrounding cells of a building in fire. The same for
   ambulances.
1. Firemen will extinguish a fire by remaining on the same position as in the simulation step before and in the
   surrounding cells of the building in fire. The same for ambulances.

The case of two neighbor buildings in fire and firemen/ambulances in a surrounding cell for both buildings, you have
to design how to clarify which building is a fireman/ambulance working to. This decision must be explicitly stated
in your second activity.


## Information flow

The information will flow as described in the next lines:

* The SystemAgent will load the configuration settings, such as the number of agents of any kind (AmbulanceAgents,
  HospitalAgents, FiremenAgents) as well as the number of ambulances per hospital, if applicable. In addition,
  configuration settings will define the whole simulation properties, including the size of the grid, the number of
  gas stations, and the total number of simulation steps, among others. When this step is done, simulation can
  start. SystemAgent will also communicate to the CoordinatorAgent the current city status dynamically, such as
  which fires currently exist and the burned ratio for each building.
* HospitalCoordinator will be responsible for a good average quality of service in all hospitals as mentioned above.
  To do so, HospitalAgents will share the amount of hospitalized citizens at every simulation step, as well as the
  expected number of free beds for the next simulation step.
* HospitalAgents and HospitalCoordinator will implement the chosen coordination model for ambulances and they will
  decide the actions of each ambulance.
* AmbulanceAgents have to find the fastest path to the target point to load injured citizens. They have to consider
  private vehicles that will be moving around the city and other mobile vehicles to prevent collisions. Ambulances
  also have to find the fastest way to the corresponding hospital. AmbulanceAgents will send to the HospitalAgents,
  and they to the HospitalCoordinator, the number of steps taken from its current position to reach the point of
  loading injured citizens, and then also the number of steps to reach the hospital per citizen and path. If an
  ambulance arrives at a full hospital, it will remain behind the hospital until all people enter into the hospital.
  See below for more details.
* The FiremenCoordinator will be responsible to decide the amount of firemen sent to each fire and the amount of
  time to remain on each fire. It will send a message to each FiremenAgent with its new position.
* FiremenAgents have to find the fastest path to the target fire. They have to consider private vehicles that will
  be moving around the city and other mobile vehicles to prevent collisions. FiremenAgents will send to the
  FiremenCoordinator the number of steps taken to reach the point of fire, and FiremenCoordinator will send them to
  the SystemAgent to log them.
* When all coordination tasks are completed and statistical information sent, both HospitalCoordinator and
  FiremenCoordinator will send a message OK to the CoordinatorAgent, which will forward it to the SystemAgent. Then,
  the SystemAgent knows that it can proceed with the next simulation step.

Any protocol message not described in this document will be defined by each workgroup to make the system work as
expected.

You will be better evaluated if you use a couple of communication mechanisms between agents. But take into accound
this: this will let you get a higher mark if and only if you give us good reasons for that.


## Statistical information

For analysis purposes, the SystemAgent will show the statistics gathered along the whole simulation process. They
will show the quality of your multiagent system design, including:

* Percentage of fires that had firemen trying to put it out.
* Percentage of fires that were totally put out.
* Average of burned ratio of buildings when the first fireman arrived.
* Percentage of people in risk due to fires.
* Percentage of people brought to hospitals.
* Percentage of dead people due to fires.
* Percentage of occupied beds by simulation steps, and their average.
* The number of buildings destroyed. This value is gathered by the SystemAgent and it is only zero if all fires are
  put out and no building is destroyed.
* The number of dead citizens. This value is also gathered by the SystemAgent and it will show the number of fire
  victims. Each building on fire has an amount of citizens in it. This statistic value will be only zero when no
  citizens have died due to the fires.

In conclusion, your design should try to miminise the number of destroyed buildings, the number of dead possible and
the number of steps (i.e., fuel) used by FiremenAgents and AmbulanceAgents.


## Optional part

The existence of gas stations and the assumption that vehicles can run out of petrol is an optional part of this
practical work. The number of gas stations will be defined in the initial configuration settings. By default it will
be zero. No gas stations means vehicles do not need to go to a gas station ever. Otherwise, vehicles (FiremenAgents
and AmbulanceAgents) have a petrol consumption of 1% per step. Vehicles can fill in petrol at any time, but this
operation will take always 3 simulation steps. A vehicle is filling in petrol when they are located in a cell
surrounding the gas station.

Only if you are sure all mandatory parts are perfect, go on with this optional task. It is better to fully complete
the mandatory parts than having them partially implemented and addressing this optional part.

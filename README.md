# Skeleton for the IMAS practical work

This is the practical work skeleton for the subject "Introduction
to MultiAgent Systems" performed in Universitat Rovira i Virgili.


# Goal

Build a skeleton from where students are asked to design and develop
a multi agent system performing several tasks, with communication as
the main cooperation mechanism.


# Scenario

A 2D city with several kind of agents (ambulances, firemen, hospitals)
are represented in the map, with private vehicles moving around.
The city map is formed by buildings and street cells where private 
vehicles and mobile agents can move throughout.

See the IMAS1415.md document to see the practical definition for the
first semester of the academic course 2014-15.

To make it easy, the game will run in simulation steps. All necessary
communication is expected to be performed in every single simulation step


# Content

This project has a NetBeans project content to make it easy to start
with. To build the multi agent system, we use JADE.

There are two run profiles:

1. Run the multi agent system, showing up the city map in 2D.
1. Run the game settings builder.

You can build your running scripts starting with those profiles.

# Authors

* Other teachers build the first skeleton.
* Based on that, the current version was revisited by: 
 * Jordi Pujol Ahull√≥ <jordi.pujol@urv.cat>, Universitat Rovira i Virgili.
